										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://realicon.co.ke/shop/product/baofeng-uv-82-walkie-talkie/">UV-82</a> Series come with a dual push-to-talk button. The dual PTT is a huge leap forward in HT technology. It allows you to transmit on two frequencies using the rocker PTT switch. By pressing up you can transmit on “Frequency A” and by pushing down you can transmit on “Frequency B”. Frequency A or B can also be used as a scanner of channels, frequencies, CTCSS, and DTS tones.</p>
<p>The BaoFeng UV-82 Series<br />
The BaoFeng UV-82 series has upped the bar on affordable ham radio technology! Compared to previous BaoFeng products (UV-5R, GT-3, and the v2+ Series) the UV-82 comes with a much louder speaker (1 watt), a much more solid case with larger buttons, and a new chipset and PCB board that outperforms the range, accuracy, and output of the previous BaoFeng chipsets. It is not simply a remake but a new radio from the ground up. It outperforms the 2nd Gen UV-5R chipset (used in the UV-5Rs, GT-3 BF-F8+, and v2+ series).</p>
<p>VERSATILE RADIO FOR AMATEUR USE<br />
The BaoFeng UV-82 is legal for use on amateur frequencies. The UV-82 is able to Transmit on Narrowband (12.5kHz) and Wideband (25kHz).</p>
<p>Dual Watch Receiver<br />
The BaoFeng UV-82 has one built-in receiver but can “watch” two channels (semi-duplex). Monitor two different frequencies (even on different bands (VHF/UHF)) and the radio will monitor both frequencies giving priority to the first station to receive an incoming call.</p>
<p>FM Broadcast Station<br />
You can listen to the FM Broadcast radio, while still monitoring your radio frequencies in the background. Any incoming call will be given priority insuring you never miss an important call while listening to the radio.</p>
<p>Group Tones supported<br />
The BaoFeng UV-82 supports the most common Analog Tones. It supports CTCSS, DCS, and DTMF calling methods. Set up your calling methods to call by group tones. Tone calling (private line) is required by most repeater applications and the UV-82 supports the latest standards</p>
<p>The BaoFeng UV-82 can even send DTMF tones. This allows for sending ANI (Caller ID) or remote commands that require DTMF tones</p>
<p>Internal VOX function<br />
The BaoFeng UV-82 has an internal VOX (Voice Operated Transmit) function for convenient hands-free operation and can be used in conjunction with the included earpiece and mic. The VOX level and VOX delay time are adjustable to your needs.</p>
<p>Customize Your Operation with channels, Programmable Buttons, and more!<br />
You can program your BaoFeng UV-82 exactly how you want it. There are 128 programmable memory channels. You can add or remove channels from the scanning list using the free computer software. You can give channels alphanumeric names, using a computer. The radio has 2 power levels (5 watts maximum), allowing you to choose how far you can communicate. You can set VFO limits using the CHIRP software. You can easily program from a PC to set up the radio to operate exactly as needed.</p>
